# PixelgradeLT Part Template

Starter WP plugin template for the code attached to LT Parts.

## About

Use this as your starting point for coding the integration of an LT Part (managed by LT Records).

## Running Tests

To run the PHPUnit tests, in the root directory of the plugin, run something like:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Unit --colors=always
```
or
```
composer run tests
```

Bear in mind that there are **simple unit tests** (hence the `--testsuite=Unit` parameter) that are very fast to run, and there are **integration tests** (`--testsuite=Integration`) that need to load the entire WordPress codebase, recreate the db, etc. Choose which ones you want to run depending on what you are after.

You can run either the unit tests or the integration tests with the following commands:

```
composer run tests-unit
```
or
```
composer run tests-integration
```

**Important:** Before you can run the tests, you need to create a `.env` file in `tests/phpunit/` with the necessary data. You can copy the already existing `.env.example` file. Further instructions are in the `.env.example` file.
